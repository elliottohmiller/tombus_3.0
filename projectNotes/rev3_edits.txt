motherboard: 

-missing designator on 0805 resistor (R11)
-polarity symbols for power filter caps
-adjust WIMA footprints for accuracy
-move lower left cap away from edge
-edit values for single instance on BOM
-adjust VCO / PWM amplifiers to run off single rail
-add feedback R in oscillator amplifier
-dial in stopper R's and add values to schematic
-check necessity for feedback R in PW circuit (R32)
-check LFO HF instability (add stopper R to prevent short) - 2k2
-add cap to remove VCO offset (VCO -> PW & BLEND)
-add gain to blend amp to take advantage of full range
-remove mod signal offsets, and add jumper for ext. A/C coupling
-buffer exponential converter bias to decouple LFO drag

-add rail + gnd test points
-Neutrik footprint...

controlboard:

-adjust control directions
-change LFO control to LIN

frontpanel:

-adjust hole diameters to fit pot shafts
